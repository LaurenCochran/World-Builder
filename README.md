A web based app where you can create characters and a world and save it to your account. 

## Implemented
- Homepage
- Character Creation
- World Creation
- SSO
- Being able to save Character and World creations as .txt files

## Facebook Login
Facebook login in implemented since I put it as one of my goals, but since I am using a site that doesn't use https and doesn't have certifigates you can only login with a test account.

## SSO
For SSO, I used firebase since it was easy to implement with my ec2 instance.
